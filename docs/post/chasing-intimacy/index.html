<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>This post heavily depends on you having read the
<a href="http://localhost:1313/disconnected/post/sex-is-sex/">previous</a>. post.</p>

<h2 id="escapism">Escapism</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always felt like I was missing something, and for the longest while I&rsquo;ve
tried to fill that void with intimacy, or sex. Perhaps recklessly so, regardless
I&rsquo;ve had a string of partners, Some good, some bad, and some just selfish
attempts to forget. Though sometimes trying to forget has just led to deepening
my scars. While I&rsquo;ve changed quite a bit over the years, I still find myself
trying to fill that empty void. Escapism is a dangerous rabbit-hole that is hard
to crawl back out of.</p>

<h2 id="lust">Lust</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to senselessly fuck the pain away many times, flinging myself towards
whoever was willing. Obviously though sex is only a temporary relief from my
real problems. Nonetheless I now find myself in a bit of an odd position. I
had sex with Ace, it was quite the traumatic experience, yet I find myself
wanting to masochistically fling myself back at him. Whenever I think about him
I feel nauseous, and I begin to derealize a bit. My mind not wanting me to
relive what happened before, yet at the same time wanting to do it again.</p>

<h2 id="ace">Ace</h2>

<p>I suppose my relationship with Ace is kinda, &ldquo;complex&rdquo; now. At first Ace and I
were just close friends. Previously I had told Ace I had feelings for him, but
he he didn&rsquo;t feel the same about me, so it never went anywhere. Though as time
went on Ace began to question himself more and had come to a point where he felt
as though he had feelings for me, but he wasn&rsquo;t completely sure. What happened
next was a few days of cuddling, kissing, and general messing around. Then as
soon as it had started and I had flung myself head-first into senseless passion,
it seemingly ended. Now I find myself selfishly craving more. I guess I&rsquo;m back
where I started, just close friends, and feeling a bit dejected over Ace&rsquo;s lack
of interest in me.</p>
