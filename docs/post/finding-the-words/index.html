<h2 id="a-bit-of-preface">A bit of Preface</h2>

<p>For years, I&rsquo;ve always struggled to put into words, what exactly DPDR made me
feel. Then, I stumbled upon a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/6ktual/vent_chronic_dp_since_childhood_has_stripped_all/">post</a> on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr">r/dpdr</a> that for the most part, put
it into words, perfectly, this post was written by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lunar_limbo">u/lunar_limbo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-train-that-hit-me">The Train That Hit Me</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I have always held great empathy. To the point I would be overcome by others stories. I would live them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, the first thing after the preface, tugged at my heart strings right away.
I instantly connected with luna right here, for throughout the years I&rsquo;ve had
DPDR, while feeling robbed of my own feelings, I was always able to empathize
with others on a level I never saw among my peers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am nothing. Merely a reflecting pond for others to find meaning in their lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For years I&rsquo;ve tried to help others with their lives, hoping someday to find
some way to make my own better, but in doing so, largely only ended up helping
others. A sad consequence of this has been the further erosion of my own
identity. In that sense, I too am merely a reflection pond.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am incapable of holding healthy people&rsquo;s attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While for me, not entirely true (as I&rsquo;ve learned to mesh into social
environments). It still resonates with me because of my own social
difficulties I&rsquo;ve encountered due to DPDR.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DP killed me before I ever had a chance. I can only cope inside.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, a snippet of the penultimate paragraph is what really hit home for me,
what made me feel I wasn&rsquo;t entirely alone. I too feel like DPDR silently
stripped my identity from me, before I was able to ever solidify it.</p>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>

<p>I can not put into words how greatful I am for stumbling upon luna&rsquo;s post, it
laid to rest the struggle for words I have tried to find for so long.</p>
