    <h1 class="title">Foolish Bravado?</h1>
      
    <div class="content">
      

<p>I was foolish&hellip;oh so foolish, to think nothing would come of that week with Ace.
To think I&rsquo;d just walk away scot-free was laughable, I&rsquo;m far too fragile for
that to have been the outcome. Now I can&rsquo;t even say sorry and explain why. I let
Ace think he wouldn&rsquo;t hurt me, I let him think things would change, and maybe
they haven&rsquo;t, and maybe I&rsquo;ve just been overreacting to all of this.</p>

<h2 id="regret">Regret</h2>

<p>At the time I had reassured Ace nothing would change and that he wouldn&rsquo;t hurt
me, in hindsight that was a grave mistake. Now I&rsquo;m having flashbacks,
daydreaming, having panic attacks, and generally overthinking about the whole
thing. I know it&rsquo;s just my mind trying to process everything that happened, but
it&rsquo;s hard to not feel like it was something that could&rsquo;ve been easily avoided.
I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;ve been rambling about this whole thing for a total of 3 posts, but
that&rsquo;s how much this has been getting to me. It&rsquo;s something that is constantly
on my mind. I have no reason to apologize to Ace, I really owe no one an apology
besides myself.</p>

<h3 id="apologies">Apologies</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned being sorry and wanting to apologize a few times throughout this
post without really providing propper context first. What initially brought on
this panic attack and subsuquent rambling post was a simple few words.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m really sorry, for everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I typed it without even thinking really, something deep inside me just knew to
type the words. Ace of course, asked what I was sorry about, reading his reply
released a torrent of emotions. The ensuing flood of emotions and thoughts caused
me to sieze up. I wanted so desperately to tell him why&hellip;but I just ended up
just backing out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nvm&ndash;I wasn&rsquo;t in the right frame of mind when I typed that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At that point I was dealing with a full blown panic attack and didn&rsquo;t really
take in much of what Ace had said after that. I ended up just going to bed,
hoping to sleep off the panic attack.</p>
