      <div class="content">
        Cesc has my heart, but I feel we&rsquo;re too different. The first major difference between us I can think of is that Cesc wants kids and I really don&rsquo;t, I guess another thing that has perturbed me before about Cesc is that they&rsquo;ve told me I&rsquo;m not feminine in appearance enough, which while sadly true, still felt hurtful. I can&rsquo;t blame someone for having preferences though. I guess I&rsquo;m just love-sick.

      <h1 class="title"><a href="https://lucynaess.github.io/disconnected/post/background-noise/">Background Noise</a></h1>
      <div class="content">
        Sometimes depersonalization makes me feel like I&rsquo;m no more than background noise. The sense of detatchment from my surroundings socially, but not physically leads to me observing quite a bit instead of interacting. I think this may be part of the reason I enjoy &ldquo;people watching&rdquo; so much, (walking around and just observing people) because it gives me an opportunity to just forget I exist. While Sometimes it&rsquo;s blissful to feel like unimportant background noise, at other times it&rsquo;s crippling.

      <div class="content">
        More than a month later I know recognize how foolish my initial panic was when it came to what happened with Ace, though perhaps not entirely preventable. It reminds me of years ago when I was much younger and how I&rsquo;d over-dramatically panic in reaction to something upsetting. While there is a small amout of regret for the actions I took, it&rsquo;s ultimately not the end of the world. I think sometimes we need to remind ourselves that even when something truamatic happens and it feels as though everything comes to a crashing halt, the world around you is still going on just as it always has, and will.

      <div class="content">
        I was foolish&hellip;oh so foolish, to think nothing would come of that week with Ace. To think I&rsquo;d just walk away scot-free was laughable, I&rsquo;m far too fragile for that to have been the outcome. Now I can&rsquo;t even say sorry and explain why. I let Ace think he wouldn&rsquo;t hurt me, I let him think things would change, and maybe they haven&rsquo;t, and maybe I&rsquo;ve just been overreacting to all of this.

      <div class="content">
        Preface This post heavily depends on you having read the previous. post.
Escapism I&rsquo;ve always felt like I was missing something, and for the longest while I&rsquo;ve tried to fill that void with intimacy, or sex. Perhaps recklessly so, regardless I&rsquo;ve had a string of partners, Some good, some bad, and some just selfish attempts to forget. Though sometimes trying to forget has just led to deepening my scars. While I&rsquo;ve changed quite a bit over the years, I still find myself trying to fill that empty void.

      <div class="content">
        Preface So, I guess this one is going to be a heavy one, or perhaps I just think I&rsquo;m going to be deep. I had a sexual experience for the first time in a while, though this time it was accompanied by a horrifyingly heavy bout of dissociation. During and after sex I was thrown into a horribly uncomfortable detachment from &ldquo;myself&rdquo;. To make things easier (and for privacy), I&rsquo;ll refer to the friend I had sex with as &ldquo;Ace&rdquo;.

      <div class="content">
        A Curse and a Blessing For me, racing thoughts are a double edged sword. On one hand, it allows for fast reaction time, but it also never really stops. My thoughts are like a train without breaks. Until I hit the bed and pass out, it doesn&rsquo;t stop. Like many things, I&rsquo;ve grown somewhat accustom to it.
Another downside of having racing thoughts is that when I think about something negative, my brain often latches on and won&rsquo;t let go of the thought.

      <div class="content">
        A bit of Preface For years, I&rsquo;ve always struggled to put into words, what exactly DPDR made me feel. Then, I stumbled upon a post on r/dpdr that for the most part, put it into words, perfectly, this post was written by u/lunar_limbo.
The Train That Hit Me  I have always held great empathy. To the point I would be overcome by others stories. I would live them.

      <div class="content">
        Depersonalization and being Transgender. A lack of identity, and feeling psychically disconnected from my body, combined with a sense of being born the wrong gender presents an interesting mix of feelings, or lack thereof. Normally one would expect a transgender person to be unhappy with their birth sex, and yes, while I&rsquo;m generally dissatisfied being in a male body, over the years the feeling that I&rsquo;m &ldquo;connected&rdquo; with my physical body has more or less eroded away.
