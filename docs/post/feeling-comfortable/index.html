<h2 id="a-bit-of-a-problem">A bit of a problem</h2>

<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s read any of my previous posts will know that I&rsquo;m dissatisfied with
my gender. There are some aspects of being a male that don&rsquo;t appeal to me
personally. As a possible solution, I&rsquo;ve thought about hormone therapy as an
avenue to resolving my gender dysphoria. This is a difficult decision to make,
not so much because I don&rsquo;t want to do it, but rather the heavy and permanent
consequences associated with it.</p>

<h3 id="commitment">Commitment</h3>

<p>Transitioning (no pun intended) is a lifelong commitment, and not something you
can really go back on all the way. It&rsquo;s important to know that <strong>you</strong> want to
make this commitment and stick with it. That you can fully embrace you decision,
that being said, decisions like these don&rsquo;t come without apprehension. Though
I&rsquo;m sure my apprehension will my relieved once I star transition to a body I
feel more comfortable with.</p>

<h3 id="social-impact">Social Impact</h3>

<p>The social reactions of people who find out you&rsquo;re trans, or am planning on
transitioning can either be heart-warming, or bone-chilling (or anything in
between really). My worst fear though would be my parents disowning me. While
I&rsquo;ve never been particularly close with my family, it&rsquo;d just deepen the rift I
already feel. Luckily all the friends I&rsquo;ve told have been very supportive of me.</p>

<h3 id="everyday-crap">Everyday crap</h3>

<p>With (at the time of writing this) the recent news about the AHCA, being trans
will be classified (as one of the many) &ldquo;pre-existing&rdquo; conditions someone can be
denied health insurance based on. The want to wear clothes of the gender you&rsquo;re
transitioning to can also become a &ldquo;problem&rdquo;, making others &ldquo;uncomfortable&rdquo;.
Also, general hostility towards trans people (that I&rsquo;ve read) can make it harder
to find a job, find a place to live, or any array of simple everyday tasks.</p>
