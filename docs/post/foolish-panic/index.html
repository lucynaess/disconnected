<p>More than a month later I know recognize how foolish my initial panic was when
it came to what happened with Ace, though perhaps not entirely preventable. It reminds me of years ago when I was much younger and how I&rsquo;d over-dramatically
panic in reaction to something upsetting. While there is a small amout of regret
for the actions I took, it&rsquo;s ultimately not the end of the world. I think
sometimes we need to remind ourselves that even when something truamatic happens
and it feels as though everything comes to a crashing halt, the world around you
is still going on just as it always has, and will.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s taken time for my mind to fully comprehend all of what happened with Ace,
but I&rsquo;m glad to say for the most part it no longer haunts me. Rather my memories
of hanging out with Ace are warm ones, sans my crippling panic attack.</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

<p>When I wrote my last blog post I was in the mindset that writing more blog posts
would help, yet what really helped was a bit of a nostolgia trip. Sometime after
my last blog post I become more and more concerned with my personal identity and
who I was, an issue that&rsquo;s haunted me all of my life. The way I went about this
was just going through archives of what had to be hundreds of emails I had with
old freinds and acquaintances, seeing how I&rsquo;ve grown as a person over the years.
It&rsquo;s actually amazing how much I&rsquo;ve changed as a person! Though that is a post
for another time.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>In conclusion, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about not only myself over the past few
months, but I&rsquo;ve learned how to handle certain situations that may happen again.
I&rsquo;m glad I spent the time with Ace that I did.</p>
