      <description>Preface This is a continuation of a previous post, wherein we talked about trust.
Information I&amp;rsquo;m less trusting then I&amp;rsquo;d honestly like to admit. While I feel I can tell certain close friends some things, I feel as though I can&amp;rsquo;t tell them other things. Mostly do to feeling self conscious, or not wanting them to find something out about me. There are a fair few people even in my inner circle of friends who I would not tell that this blog exists.</description>

      <title>Personal Space: NSFW</title>

      <description>Preface This is going to be another post that just rambles.
A bit of context I prefer, most of the time, to not have my personal space violated, I&amp;rsquo;d assume this is the norm among the majority of people. For me it stems from trust issues that I&amp;rsquo;ve had for quite a while now. I won&amp;rsquo;t scream or pitch a fight if my personal space is violated, rather I try to tell the person who violated it not to make the same mistake again.</description>
