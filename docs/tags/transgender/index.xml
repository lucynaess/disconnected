      <description>My experience with DPDR is only that now, an experience. While it has shaped who I am, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say it dominates my life. What does dominate my life is the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m still in the closet about being trans (MtF). The only people who really know are typically close friends, and it&amp;rsquo;s not for a lack of support. My parents would most likely totally support me, it&amp;rsquo;s more-so crippling anxiety.</description>

      <description>Depersonalization and being Transgender. A lack of identity, and feeling psychically disconnected from my body, combined with a sense of being born the wrong gender presents an interesting mix of feelings, or lack thereof. Normally one would expect a transgender person to be unhappy with their birth sex, and yes, while I&amp;rsquo;m generally dissatisfied being in a male body, over the years the feeling that I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;connected&amp;rdquo; with my physical body has more or less eroded away.</description>
