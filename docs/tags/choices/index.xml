      <description>Preface This post heavily depends on you having read the previous. post.
Escapism I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt like I was missing something, and for the longest while I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to fill that void with intimacy, or sex. Perhaps recklessly so, regardless I&amp;rsquo;ve had a string of partners, Some good, some bad, and some just selfish attempts to forget. Though sometimes trying to forget has just led to deepening my scars. While I&amp;rsquo;ve changed quite a bit over the years, I still find myself trying to fill that empty void.</description>

      <description>Preface So, I guess this one is going to be a heavy one, or perhaps I just think I&amp;rsquo;m going to be deep. I had a sexual experience for the first time in a while, though this time it was accompanied by a horrifyingly heavy bout of dissociation. During and after sex I was thrown into a horribly uncomfortable detachment from &amp;ldquo;myself&amp;rdquo;. To make things easier (and for privacy), I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to the friend I had sex with as &amp;ldquo;Ace&amp;rdquo;.</description>
