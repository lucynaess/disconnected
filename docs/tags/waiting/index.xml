      <description>I feel like maintaing hope is analogous to maintaining the light in a lighthouse. I try to maintain hope to feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished something, or to keep optimistic. I don&amp;rsquo;t maintain hope solely for myself though, I do it for others, so that in dark times they may see as a guiding light. A reason not to give up quite yet, and to carry on. Sometimes I do maintain hope for selfish reasons though, hoping for something to happen, or for someone to come back when I know it won&amp;rsquo;t happen.</description>
