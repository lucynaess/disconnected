      <description>More than a month later I know recognize how foolish my initial panic was when it came to what happened with Ace, though perhaps not entirely preventable. It reminds me of years ago when I was much younger and how I&amp;rsquo;d over-dramatically panic in reaction to something upsetting. While there is a small amout of regret for the actions I took, it&amp;rsquo;s ultimately not the end of the world. I think sometimes we need to remind ourselves that even when something truamatic happens and it feels as though everything comes to a crashing halt, the world around you is still going on just as it always has, and will.</description>

      <description>I was foolish&amp;hellip;oh so foolish, to think nothing would come of that week with Ace. To think I&amp;rsquo;d just walk away scot-free was laughable, I&amp;rsquo;m far too fragile for that to have been the outcome. Now I can&amp;rsquo;t even say sorry and explain why. I let Ace think he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt me, I let him think things would change, and maybe they haven&amp;rsquo;t, and maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve just been overreacting to all of this.</description>
