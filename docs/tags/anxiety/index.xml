      <description>My experience with DPDR is only that now, an experience. While it has shaped who I am, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say it dominates my life. What does dominate my life is the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m still in the closet about being trans (MtF). The only people who really know are typically close friends, and it&amp;rsquo;s not for a lack of support. My parents would most likely totally support me, it&amp;rsquo;s more-so crippling anxiety.</description>
