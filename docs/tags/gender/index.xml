      <description>Depersonalization and being Transgender. A lack of identity, and feeling psychically disconnected from my body, combined with a sense of being born the wrong gender presents an interesting mix of feelings, or lack thereof. Normally one would expect a transgender person to be unhappy with their birth sex, and yes, while I&amp;rsquo;m generally dissatisfied being in a male body, over the years the feeling that I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;connected&amp;rdquo; with my physical body has more or less eroded away.</description>

      <description>A bit of a problem Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s read any of my previous posts will know that I&amp;rsquo;m dissatisfied with my gender. There are some aspects of being a male that don&amp;rsquo;t appeal to me personally. As a possible solution, I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about hormone therapy as an avenue to resolving my gender dysphoria. This is a difficult decision to make, not so much because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do it, but rather the heavy and permanent consequences associated with it.</description>

      <description>Limbo For the past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself in a sort of uncomfortable limbo, stuck between the want to abandon a gender which offers me little comfort, and identity I have no connection to, or to stick with my current gender in fear of the social stigmas I may face. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, uncertain what to do.
Trapped Ironically, it&amp;rsquo;s not my sexual organs that bring my discomfort when it comes to my gender.</description>

      <description>Preface: NSFW. This one might get weird, and rambly. That&amp;rsquo;s the difficulty with writing about things you don&amp;rsquo;t remember clearly.
What is Gender Dysphoria? As not everybody reading this might know what gender dysphoria is right off, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to provide a simple definition. Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person emotionally and psychologically identifies as the opposite of one&amp;rsquo;s biological sex. E.g.
 A person who is biologically male would identify as female.</description>
