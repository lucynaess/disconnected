      <title>Chasing Exhaustion</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been emotionally exhausted for quite a while. After being seemingly ghosted by my most recent partner, I just don&amp;rsquo;t feel anything. Sure for a while I did feel sad and such, but, now I just feel tired. I suppose going from one relationship to the next has grown old. I&amp;rsquo;d rather cherish strong meaningful friendships at the moment. I really have no incentive to jump head-first into yet another relationship.</description>

      <description>Cesc has my heart, but I feel we&amp;rsquo;re too different. The first major difference between us I can think of is that Cesc wants kids and I really don&amp;rsquo;t, I guess another thing that has perturbed me before about Cesc is that they&amp;rsquo;ve told me I&amp;rsquo;m not feminine in appearance enough, which while sadly true, still felt hurtful. I can&amp;rsquo;t blame someone for having preferences though. I guess I&amp;rsquo;m just love-sick.</description>

      <title>Identity and Dissociation</title>

      <description>Identity, and Names A beautiful quote form a Disqus Blog post. In fact I find the quote quite aptly describes me. For example, I detest my birth name. While people I know in real life use it, when online friends refer to me by my online pseudonym, for some reason I find it less jarring.
If I had to guess, the reason for this is because the majority of friends I&amp;rsquo;ve made throughout my life, have been online, so my sense of identity online strengthened while I dissociated from my real identity more and more.</description>

      <title>Personal Space: NSFW</title>

      <description>Preface This is going to be another post that just rambles.
A bit of context I prefer, most of the time, to not have my personal space violated, I&amp;rsquo;d assume this is the norm among the majority of people. For me it stems from trust issues that I&amp;rsquo;ve had for quite a while now. I won&amp;rsquo;t scream or pitch a fight if my personal space is violated, rather I try to tell the person who violated it not to make the same mistake again.</description>
