      <title>Casual Sex and Emotional Investment</title>

      <description>In past posts where I wrote about sex and the horrible truamatic epxeriences and thoughts that followed it, I often expressed a great deal of dread and anxiety. Usually while writing them I was in a panic, my mind racing at incredible speeds. I now write with a steady hand, and a calm, clear mind.
Casual sex can be great, it can allow you to relieve pent up desires, to be intimate with another person, to bond even more with someone else.</description>

      <description>Preface This post heavily depends on you having read the previous. post.
Escapism I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt like I was missing something, and for the longest while I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to fill that void with intimacy, or sex. Perhaps recklessly so, regardless I&amp;rsquo;ve had a string of partners, Some good, some bad, and some just selfish attempts to forget. Though sometimes trying to forget has just led to deepening my scars. While I&amp;rsquo;ve changed quite a bit over the years, I still find myself trying to fill that empty void.</description>

      <title>Sex, is Sex: NSFW</title>

      <description>Preface So, I guess this one is going to be a heavy one, or perhaps I just think I&amp;rsquo;m going to be deep. I had a sexual experience for the first time in a while, though this time it was accompanied by a horrifyingly heavy bout of dissociation. During and after sex I was thrown into a horribly uncomfortable detachment from &amp;ldquo;myself&amp;rdquo;. To make things easier (and for privacy), I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to the friend I had sex with as &amp;ldquo;Ace&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>A bit of Preface For years, I&amp;rsquo;ve always struggled to put into words, what exactly DPDR made me feel. Then, I stumbled upon a post on r/dpdr that for the most part, put it into words, perfectly, this post was written by u/lunar_limbo.
The Train That Hit Me  I have always held great empathy. To the point I would be overcome by others stories. I would live them.
 This, the first thing after the preface, tugged at my heart strings right away.</description>

      <title>A Chilling Lack of Discomfort Part 1</title>

      <description>Depersonalization and being Transgender. A lack of identity, and feeling psychically disconnected from my body, combined with a sense of being born the wrong gender presents an interesting mix of feelings, or lack thereof. Normally one would expect a transgender person to be unhappy with their birth sex, and yes, while I&amp;rsquo;m generally dissatisfied being in a male body, over the years the feeling that I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;connected&amp;rdquo; with my physical body has more or less eroded away.</description>

      <title>Feeling Comfortable</title>

      <description>A bit of a problem Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s read any of my previous posts will know that I&amp;rsquo;m dissatisfied with my gender. There are some aspects of being a male that don&amp;rsquo;t appeal to me personally. As a possible solution, I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about hormone therapy as an avenue to resolving my gender dysphoria. This is a difficult decision to make, not so much because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do it, but rather the heavy and permanent consequences associated with it.</description>

      <title>Identity and Dissociation</title>

      <description>Identity, and Names A beautiful quote form a Disqus Blog post. In fact I find the quote quite aptly describes me. For example, I detest my birth name. While people I know in real life use it, when online friends refer to me by my online pseudonym, for some reason I find it less jarring.
If I had to guess, the reason for this is because the majority of friends I&amp;rsquo;ve made throughout my life, have been online, so my sense of identity online strengthened while I dissociated from my real identity more and more.</description>

      <title>Dysphoria: NSFW</title>

      <description>Preface: NSFW. This one might get weird, and rambly. That&amp;rsquo;s the difficulty with writing about things you don&amp;rsquo;t remember clearly.
What is Gender Dysphoria? As not everybody reading this might know what gender dysphoria is right off, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to provide a simple definition. Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person emotionally and psychologically identifies as the opposite of one&amp;rsquo;s biological sex. E.g.
 A person who is biologically male would identify as female.</description>
