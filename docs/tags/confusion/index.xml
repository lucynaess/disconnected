      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been emotionally exhausted for quite a while. After being seemingly ghosted by my most recent partner, I just don&amp;rsquo;t feel anything. Sure for a while I did feel sad and such, but, now I just feel tired. I suppose going from one relationship to the next has grown old. I&amp;rsquo;d rather cherish strong meaningful friendships at the moment. I really have no incentive to jump head-first into yet another relationship.</description>

      <description>Cesc has my heart, but I feel we&amp;rsquo;re too different. The first major difference between us I can think of is that Cesc wants kids and I really don&amp;rsquo;t, I guess another thing that has perturbed me before about Cesc is that they&amp;rsquo;ve told me I&amp;rsquo;m not feminine in appearance enough, which while sadly true, still felt hurtful. I can&amp;rsquo;t blame someone for having preferences though. I guess I&amp;rsquo;m just love-sick.</description>
