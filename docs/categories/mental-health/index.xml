      <title>Chasing Intimacy</title>

      <description>Preface This post heavily depends on you having read the previous. post.
Escapism I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt like I was missing something, and for the longest while I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to fill that void with intimacy, or sex. Perhaps recklessly so, regardless I&amp;rsquo;ve had a string of partners, Some good, some bad, and some just selfish attempts to forget. Though sometimes trying to forget has just led to deepening my scars. While I&amp;rsquo;ve changed quite a bit over the years, I still find myself trying to fill that empty void.</description>

      <title>Sex, is Sex: NSFW</title>

      <description>Preface So, I guess this one is going to be a heavy one, or perhaps I just think I&amp;rsquo;m going to be deep. I had a sexual experience for the first time in a while, though this time it was accompanied by a horrifyingly heavy bout of dissociation. During and after sex I was thrown into a horribly uncomfortable detachment from &amp;ldquo;myself&amp;rdquo;. To make things easier (and for privacy), I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to the friend I had sex with as &amp;ldquo;Ace&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Racing Thoughts</title>

      <description>A Curse and a Blessing For me, racing thoughts are a double edged sword. On one hand, it allows for fast reaction time, but it also never really stops. My thoughts are like a train without breaks. Until I hit the bed and pass out, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop. Like many things, I&amp;rsquo;ve grown somewhat accustom to it.
Another downside of having racing thoughts is that when I think about something negative, my brain often latches on and won&amp;rsquo;t let go of the thought.</description>

      <description>A bit of Preface For years, I&amp;rsquo;ve always struggled to put into words, what exactly DPDR made me feel. Then, I stumbled upon a post on r/dpdr that for the most part, put it into words, perfectly, this post was written by u/lunar_limbo.
The Train That Hit Me  I have always held great empathy. To the point I would be overcome by others stories. I would live them.</description>

      <title>A Chilling Lack of Discomfort Part 1</title>
      <link>https://lucynaess.github.io/disconnected/post/a-chilling-lack-of-1/</link>

      <description>Depersonalization and being Transgender. A lack of identity, and feeling psychically disconnected from my body, combined with a sense of being born the wrong gender presents an interesting mix of feelings, or lack thereof. Normally one would expect a transgender person to be unhappy with their birth sex, and yes, while I&amp;rsquo;m generally dissatisfied being in a male body, over the years the feeling that I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;connected&amp;rdquo; with my physical body has more or less eroded away.</description>

      <title>Feeling Comfortable</title>

      <description>A bit of a problem Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s read any of my previous posts will know that I&amp;rsquo;m dissatisfied with my gender. There are some aspects of being a male that don&amp;rsquo;t appeal to me personally. As a possible solution, I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about hormone therapy as an avenue to resolving my gender dysphoria. This is a difficult decision to make, not so much because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do it, but rather the heavy and permanent consequences associated with it.</description>

      <title>Trust</title>

      <description>Preface This is a continuation of a previous post, wherein we talked about trust.
Information I&amp;rsquo;m less trusting then I&amp;rsquo;d honestly like to admit. While I feel I can tell certain close friends some things, I feel as though I can&amp;rsquo;t tell them other things. Mostly do to feeling self conscious, or not wanting them to find something out about me. There are a fair few people even in my inner circle of friends who I would not tell that this blog exists.</description>

      <title>Dysphoria Continued: NSFW</title>

      <description>Limbo For the past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself in a sort of uncomfortable limbo, stuck between the want to abandon a gender which offers me little comfort, and identity I have no connection to, or to stick with my current gender in fear of the social stigmas I may face. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, uncertain what to do.
Trapped Ironically, it&amp;rsquo;s not my sexual organs that bring my discomfort when it comes to my gender.</description>

      <title>Identity and Dissociation</title>
      <link>https://lucynaess.github.io/disconnected/post/identity-and-dissociation/</link>

      <description>Identity, and Names A beautiful quote form a Disqus Blog post. In fact I find the quote quite aptly describes me. For example, I detest my birth name. While people I know in real life use it, when online friends refer to me by my online pseudonym, for some reason I find it less jarring.
If I had to guess, the reason for this is because the majority of friends I&amp;rsquo;ve made throughout my life, have been online, so my sense of identity online strengthened while I dissociated from my real identity more and more.</description>

      <title>Personal Space: NSFW</title>

      <description>Preface This is going to be another post that just rambles.
A bit of context I prefer, most of the time, to not have my personal space violated, I&amp;rsquo;d assume this is the norm among the majority of people. For me it stems from trust issues that I&amp;rsquo;ve had for quite a while now. I won&amp;rsquo;t scream or pitch a fight if my personal space is violated, rather I try to tell the person who violated it not to make the same mistake again.</description>

      <title>Dysphoria: NSFW</title>

      <description>Preface: NSFW. This one might get weird, and rambly. That&amp;rsquo;s the difficulty with writing about things you don&amp;rsquo;t remember clearly.
What is Gender Dysphoria? As not everybody reading this might know what gender dysphoria is right off, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to provide a simple definition. Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person emotionally and psychologically identifies as the opposite of one&amp;rsquo;s biological sex. E.g.
 A person who is biologically male would identify as female.</description>
