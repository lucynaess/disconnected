      <description>In past posts where I wrote about sex and the horrible truamatic epxeriences and thoughts that followed it, I often expressed a great deal of dread and anxiety. Usually while writing them I was in a panic, my mind racing at incredible speeds. I now write with a steady hand, and a calm, clear mind.
Casual sex can be great, it can allow you to relieve pent up desires, to be intimate with another person, to bond even more with someone else.</description>

      <title>Maintaining Lighthouses</title>

      <description>I feel like maintaing hope is analogous to maintaining the light in a lighthouse. I try to maintain hope to feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished something, or to keep optimistic. I don&amp;rsquo;t maintain hope solely for myself though, I do it for others, so that in dark times they may see as a guiding light. A reason not to give up quite yet, and to carry on. Sometimes I do maintain hope for selfish reasons though, hoping for something to happen, or for someone to come back when I know it won&amp;rsquo;t happen.</description>
