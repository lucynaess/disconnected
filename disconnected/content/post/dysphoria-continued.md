## Limbo

For the past few days I've found myself in a sort of uncomfortable limbo, stuck
between the want to abandon a gender which offers me little comfort, and
identity I have no connection to, or to stick with my current gender in fear of
the social stigmas I may face. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, uncertain
what to do.

## Trapped

Ironically, it's not my sexual organs that bring my discomfort when it comes to
my gender. Rather the hair on my body. Hair on my legs, my face, under my arms,
etc. Combined with the fact that no matter how much I shave, the hair seems to
come back relatively quick. Whether I actually want to change my gender, or
rather just purge my body of unwanted hair is something I've given lengthy
consideratoin to. One is a decision that bears much less impactful weight. All
in all, perhaps I'd just be happier being a trap then full-on changing my
gender. Regardless, my body hair leaves me feeling uncomfortable and trapped.

## Social Stigmatism

While changing your name at first may be awkward, it's certainly not as
stigamtised as changing ones gender. In the environment I live in now, I feel
as though transitioning could be social suicide. As a talented soon-to-be
highschool graduate, I would hate to negatively impact my chances at getting
any form of employment or housing. Even worse-yet, having those things yet still
being in a toxic social environment. It'd be one thing **not** to have a job or,
house, but another to have a job or live were I'm disrespected and treated
horribly by coworkers and neighbours. Though I suppose the latter is better then
having no job or house at all.
