## Depersonalization and being Transgender.

A lack of identity, and feeling psychically disconnected from my body,
combined with a sense of being born the wrong gender presents an interesting
mix of feelings, or lack thereof. Normally one would expect a transgender person
to be unhappy with their birth sex, and yes, while I'm generally dissatisfied
being in a male body, over the years the feeling that I'm "connected" with my
physical body has more or less eroded away. This has created a very warped sense
of how I perceive my body, my body is less-so "me", and more-so just a vessel.

I view my consciousness and body as separate, and while this lends me a certain
amount of comfort, it also often leads to odd quirks. One example is looking in
the mirror, when I look in the mirror it's typically a very jarring experience
as my mind seems to reject the body I'm in and sometimes perceives my reflection
as a different person.
