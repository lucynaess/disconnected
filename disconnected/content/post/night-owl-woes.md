I thought I'd write something a bit less heavy this time. I'm a "night owl",
which if you don't know what that means, I basically am awake mostly in the
afternoon and at very late hours in the night / early morning (the opposite of
most people). I also happen to live in a small town (ironically, the larger in my
county), so there's really nothing much to do at night since the town is "dead".
This coupled with the fact that a majority of my local friends are not night
owls often leaves me quite lonely feeling during the night. At times I long to
live somewhere a tad bigger with 24/7 public transportation, so if I felt like
going out somewhere I easily could hop a train or bus to a bigger city and find
something to do.
