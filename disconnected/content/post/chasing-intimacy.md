## Preface

This post heavily depends on you having read the
[previous](http://localhost:1313/disconnected/post/sex-is-sex/). post.

## Escapism

I've always felt like I was missing something, and for the longest while I've
tried to fill that void with intimacy, or sex. Perhaps recklessly so, regardless
I've had a string of partners, Some good, some bad, and some just selfish
attempts to forget. Though sometimes trying to forget has just led to deepening
my scars. While I've changed quite a bit over the years, I still find myself
trying to fill that empty void. Escapism is a dangerous rabbit-hole that is hard
to crawl back out of.

## Lust

I've tried to senselessly fuck the pain away many times, flinging myself towards
whoever was willing. Obviously though sex is only a temporary relief from my
real problems. Nonetheless I now find myself in a bit of an odd position. I
had sex with Ace, it was quite the traumatic experience, yet I find myself
wanting to masochistically fling myself back at him. Whenever I think about him
I feel nauseous, and I begin to derealize a bit. My mind not wanting me to
relive what happened before, yet at the same time wanting to do it again.

## Ace

I suppose my relationship with Ace is kinda, "complex" now. At first Ace and I
were just close friends. Previously I had told Ace I had feelings for him, but
he he didn't feel the same about me, so it never went anywhere. Though as time
went on Ace began to question himself more and had come to a point where he felt
as though he had feelings for me, but he wasn't completely sure. What happened
next was a few days of cuddling, kissing, and general messing around. Then as
soon as it had started and I had flung myself head-first into senseless passion,
it seemingly ended. Now I find myself selfishly craving more. I guess I'm back
where I started, just close friends, and feeling a bit dejected over Ace's lack
of interest in me.
