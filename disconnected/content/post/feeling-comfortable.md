## A bit of a problem

Anyone who's read any of my previous posts will know that I'm disatisfied with
my gender. There are some aspects of being a male that don't appeal to me
personally. As a possible solution, I've thought about hormone therapy as an
avenue to resolving my gender dysphoria. This is a difficult decision to make,
not so much because I don't want to do it, but rather the heavy and permanent
consequences associated with it.
