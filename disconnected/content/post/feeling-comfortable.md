## A bit of a problem

Anyone who's read any of my previous posts will know that I'm dissatisfied with
my gender. There are some aspects of being a male that don't appeal to me
personally. As a possible solution, I've thought about hormone therapy as an
avenue to resolving my gender dysphoria. This is a difficult decision to make,
not so much because I don't want to do it, but rather the heavy and permanent
consequences associated with it.

### Commitment

Transitioning (no pun intended) is a lifelong commitment, and not something you
can really go back on all the way. It's important to know that **you** want to
make this commitment and stick with it. That you can fully embrace you decision,
that being said, decisions like these don't come without apprehension. Though
I'm sure my apprehension will my relieved once I star transition to a body I
feel more comfortable with.

### Social Impact

The social reactions of people who find out you're trans, or am planning on
transitioning can either be heart-warming, or bone-chilling (or anything in
between really). My worst fear though would be my parents disowning me. While
I've never been particularly close with my family, it'd just deepen the rift I
already feel. Luckily all the friends I've told have been very supportive of me.

### Everyday crap

With (at the time of writing this) the recent news about the AHCA, being trans
will be classified (as one of the many) "pre-existing" conditions someone can be
denied health insurance based on. The want to wear clothes of the gender you're
transitioning to can also become a "problem", making others "uncomfortable".
Also, general hostility towards trans people (that I've read) can make it harder
to find a job, find a place to live, or any array of simple everyday tasks.
