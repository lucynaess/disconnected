## Preface

This is a continuation of [a previous post](/disconnected/post/personal-space/), wherein we talked
about trust.

## Information

I'm less trusting then I'd honestly like to admit. While I feel I can tell
certain close friends some things, I feel as though I can't tell them other
things. Mostly do to feeling self conscious, or not wanting them to find
something out about me. There are a fair few people even in my inner circle of
friends who I would not tell that this blog exists. There are some who I'd only
show specific pages to them, trusting them not to look at the rest. My self
consciousness often leads me to be very picky about what information I share
with what people, mostly afraid of how people would react if they knew certain
things about me.
