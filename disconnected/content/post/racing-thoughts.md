## A Curse and a Blessing

For me, racing thoughts are a double edged sword. On one hand, it allows for
fast reaction time, but it also never really stops. My thoughts are like a train
without breaks. Until I hit the bed and pass out, it doesn't stop. Like many
things, I've grown somewhat accustom to it.

Another downside of having racing thoughts is that when I think about something
negative, my brain often latches on and won't let go of the thought. Which
causes me to overthink things quite often. It's usually harmful and causes me
added stress.
