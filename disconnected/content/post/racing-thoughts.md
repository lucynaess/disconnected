## A Curse and a Blessing

For me, racing thoughts are a double edged sword. One one hand, it allows for
fast reaction time, it also never really stops. My thoughts are like a train
without breaks. Until I hit the bed and pass out, it doesn't stop. Like many
things, I've grown somewhat accustom to it.

Another downside of having racing thoughts is that when I think about something
negative, my brain often latches on and won't let go of the thought.
