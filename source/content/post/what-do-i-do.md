Cesc has my heart, but I feel we're too different. The first major difference
between us I can think of is that Cesc wants kids and I **really** don't, I
guess another thing that has perturbed me before about Cesc is that they've told
me I'm not feminine in appearance enough, which while sadly true, still felt
hurtful. I can't blame someone for having preferences though. I guess I'm just
love-sick.

Honestly I don't even know if I'm genuinely attracted to Cesc or if they just
gave me something I was sorely craving.
