In past posts where I wrote about sex and the horrible truamatic epxeriences and
thoughts that followed it, I often expressed a great deal of dread and anxiety.
Usually while writing them I was in a panic, my mind racing at incredible
speeds. I now write with a steady hand, and a calm, clear mind.

Casual sex can be great, it can allow you to relieve pent up desires, to be
intimate with another person, to bond even more with someone else. That being
said, it doesn't come without risk, emotional investment is an important
compononent of any sexual relationship, no-matter the length. Emotional
investment can be anything from the bond of friendship, to loving the other
person. Emotional investment isn't, and shouldn't be a one-way street though,
when it is, it can lead to either you or the other person becoming hurt.
