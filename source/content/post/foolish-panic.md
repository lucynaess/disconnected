More than a month later I know recognize how foolish my initial panic was when
it came to what happened with Ace, though perhaps not entirely preventable. It reminds me of years ago when I was much younger and how I'd over-dramatically
panic in reaction to something upsetting. While there is a small amout of regret
for the actions I took, it's ultimately not the end of the world. I think
sometimes we need to remind ourselves that even when something truamatic happens
and it feels as though everything comes to a crashing halt, the world around you
is still going on just as it always has, and will.

## Time

It's taken time for my mind to fully comprehend all of what happened with Ace,
but I'm glad to say for the most part it no longer haunts me. Rather my memories
of hanging out with Ace are warm ones, sans my crippling panic attack.

## Reflection

When I wrote my last blog post I was in the mindset that writing more blog posts
would help, yet what really helped was a bit of a nostolgia trip. Sometime after
my last blog post I become more and more concerned with my personal identity and
who I was, an issue that's haunted me all of my life. The way I went about this
was just going through archives of what had to be hundreds of emails I had with
old freinds and acquaintances, seeing how I've grown as a person over the years.
It's actually amazing how much I've changed as a person! Though that is a post
for another time.

## Summary

In conclusion, I've learned a lot about not only myself over the past few
months, but I've learned how to handle certain situations that may happen again.
I'm glad I spent the time with Ace that I did.
