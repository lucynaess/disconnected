My experience with DPDR is only that now, an experience. While it has shaped
who I am, I wouldn't say it dominates my life. What does dominate my life is the
fact that I'm still in the closet about being trans (MtF). The only people who
really know are typically close friends, and it's not for a lack of support. My
parents would most likely totally support me, it's more-so crippling anxiety.

## "Mutism"

I'm a rather introverted person and sometimes I find it hard to say...well,
anything really. At times it even gets to the point where I desperately want to
say something, but my body physically prevents me from doing so. This combined
with intrusive thoughts can make communication very difficult, because the
intrusive thoughts will fill me with doubt which only adds more fuel to the
fire. Making me less likely, or physically capable of being able to say what I
want(ed) to.

### Intrusive Thoughts

Whenever I think about telling my parents I'm trans my mind always jumps to
thoughts like:

- What if they don't accept me?
- What if they get irrationally upset?

Which ultimately leads me to not wanting to tell them because these thoughts
will just pile up and stress me out.

## Social optics

I've always been closer to my friends than my family, and often feel I have more
familial ties with certain close friends than I do my biological family. This
generally makes me less willing to talk about my life with my family because
I'm just not all that close to them and would rather keep most of my life to
myself.
