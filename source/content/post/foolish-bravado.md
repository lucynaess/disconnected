I was foolish...oh so foolish, to think nothing would come of that week with Ace.
To think I'd just walk away scot-free was laughable, I'm far too fragile for
that to have been the outcome. Now I can't even say sorry and explain why. I let
Ace think he wouldn't hurt me, I let him think things would change, and maybe
they haven't, and maybe I've just been overreacting to all of this.

## Regret

At the time I had reassured Ace nothing would change and that he wouldn't hurt
me, in hindsight that was a grave mistake. Now I'm having flashbacks,
daydreaming, having panic attacks, and generally overthinking about the whole
thing. I know it's just my mind trying to process everything that happened, but
it's hard to not feel like it was something that could've been easily avoided.
I'm sorry I've been rambling about this whole thing for a total of 3 posts, but
that's how much this has been getting to me. It's something that is constantly
on my mind. I have no reason to apologize to Ace, I really owe no one an apology
besides myself.

### Apologies

I've mentioned being sorry and wanting to apologize a few times throughout this
post without really providing propper context first. What initially brought on
this panic attack and subsuquent rambling post was a simple few words.

> I'm really sorry, for everything.

I typed it without even thinking really, something deep inside me just knew to
type the words. Ace of course, asked what I was sorry about, reading his reply
released a torrent of emotions. The ensuing flood of emotions and thoughts caused
me to sieze up. I wanted so desperately to tell him why...but I just ended up
just backing out.

> Nvm--I wasn't in the right frame of mind when I typed that.

At that point I was dealing with a full blown panic attack and didn't really
take in much of what Ace had said after that. I ended up just going to bed,
hoping to sleep off the panic attack.
