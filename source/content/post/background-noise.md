Sometimes depersonalization makes me feel like I'm no more than background
noise. The sense of detatchment from my surroundings socially, but not
physically leads to me observing quite a bit instead of interacting. I think
this may be part of the reason I enjoy "people watching" so much, (walking
around and just observing people) because it gives me an opportunity to just
forget I exist. While Sometimes it's blissful to feel like unimportant
background noise, at other times it's crippling. I feel lost and ignored in the
sea of noise.
