DPDR used to be something that weighed me down, but after 6 or so years of
struggling to understand how I could possibly deal with it, It surprisingly
became less and less bothersome seemingly on its own. This isn't to say I
haven't learned quite a bit along the way, but at the same time it didn't feel
like I was actively trying to get rid of my DP. I think learning mindfulness
was a big part of the recovery process for me. I now need to work on my other
problems like social anxiety, and self image.
